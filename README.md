# HTML-CSS-JavaScrip
HTML is the fundamental markup language for webpages.
CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the most important tools for all your web design escapades. They complement and augment each other, and their power expounds when theyâ€™re combined.

JavaScript brings HTML to life, CSS makes HTML beautiful, and HTML gives JavaScript and CSS their structure on a web page.
