  HTML is the fundamental markup language for webpages.
</p>

<p>CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.</p>

<p>
  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the most important tools for all your web design escapades. They complement and augment each other, and their power expounds when they’re combined.

JavaScript brings HTML to life, CSS makes HTML beautiful, and HTML gives JavaScript and CSS their structure on a web page.

The main three languages used in web page development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In general:
<p>HTML provides the structure, CSS provides the presentation and formatting, and JavaScript makes the elements dynamic and controls their behavior.</p>

<h1> HTML </h1>
<p>HTML makes up this web page’s skeleton and structure, and almost every other web page you’ll ever visit. It’s a markup language that “marks up” and forms the backbone to online content, putting the site structure in place for the web browser to understand.
</p>

<h1>CSS</h1>
<p>Whereas HTML makes up the structure, or bones, of the site, CSS adds the skin. The CSS on a webpage designs it and makes it look more attractive for the visitor reading the page.</p>
<p>
  CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, shape the HTML and affects how it’s displayed to the website visitor. These forms of styling include font color, background color, border-radius (rounded corners on boxes), the position of columns, hue, opacity, and separation. New CSS features even allow for animations, flexbox gaps, and much more responsive design.
</p>

<h1>JavaScript</h1>
<p>JavaScript (JS) is another key language for web page design and inserts dynamic text into HTML client-side.

It’s a scripting language rather than a markup language.</p>
