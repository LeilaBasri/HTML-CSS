<p>CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.</p>

  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the most important tools for all your web design escapades. They complement and augment each other, and their power expounds when theyâ€™re combined.

JavaScript brings HTML to life, CSS makes HTML beautiful, and HTML gives JavaScript and CSS their structure on a web page.
